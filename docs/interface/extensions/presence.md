# Extension: Presence

![Presence](../images/presence.png)

The Presence extension allows Admin to decide in which Beacons/Zones the users' presence should be tracked.
Admin can switch Beacons/Zones monitoring by clicking a corresponding table row.

**Note:** There is no GUI to observe users presence. To get info about users presence
in Beacons/Zones you have to use [API](../../api_docs_v1/presence.md)
