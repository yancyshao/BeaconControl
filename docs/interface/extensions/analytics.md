# Extension: Analytics

![Analytics](../images/analytics.png)

The Analytics extension collects data sent by mobile clients and aggregates it to provide
data charts so that Admin can check how the application is used.

Currently there are 3 types of charts available:
* DwellTime - what's the average dwell time inside Beacon's range or Zone's range
* Actions - how many times the actions were invoked in total, split by day
* Active Users - how many unique users per day appeared within the range of a Beacon / Zone
