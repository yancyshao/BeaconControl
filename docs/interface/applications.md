# Applications

![Applications](images/applications.png)

Here a user can manage his/her own applications.

In most cases you can assume (and should use) one BeaconCtrl application per one Mobile / Web application.
Please check [API Docs](../api_docs/README.md) to read more about integration with the system
when it comes to API perspective.

**Application** is the main entity in the BeaconCtrl environment. It holds information
about application-specific configuration, enabled extensions and actions that
are invoked during client's interaction with Beacons & Zones.
